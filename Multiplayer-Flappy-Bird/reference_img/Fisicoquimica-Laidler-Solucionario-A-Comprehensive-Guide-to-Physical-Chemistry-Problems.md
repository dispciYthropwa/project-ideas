One of the challenges of learning physical chemistry is solving problems that require applying theoretical principles to practical situations. Many students find it helpful to use a solution manual that provides detailed explanations and examples of how to solve different types of problems.
  
One of the most popular and widely used solution manuals for physical chemistry is Fisicoquimica Laidler Solucionario. This book is based on the textbook Fisicoquimica by Keith J. Laidler and John H. Meiser, which covers the main topics of physical chemistry in a clear and concise way. The solution manual provides step-by-step solutions to all the problems in the textbook, as well as additional exercises and questions for practice and review.
